ADViSELipidomics is a novel Shiny app for the preprocessing, analysis, and visualization of lipidomics data. It copes with the outputs from LipidSearch and LIQUID for lipid identification and quantification, and with data available from the Metabolomics Workbench. ADViSELipidomics extracts information by parsing lipid species (using LIPID MAPS classification) and, together with information available on the samples, allows performing several exploratory and statistical analyses. In the presence of internal lipid standards in the experiment, ADViSELipidomics can normalize the data matrix, providing absolute values of concentration per lipid and sample. Moreover, it allows the identification of differentially abundant lipids in simple and complex experimental designs, dealing with batch effect correction.

## Installation
ADViSELipidomics is a stand-alone application implemented using the R language (R > 4.0) and the Shiny libraries. It can be installed as any other R package on several operating systems (Windows, macOS and Linux). Before installing the package you have to perform few supplementary steps based on your operating systems:

* **Windows (tested on Windows 10 64bit)**\ 

Before installing the package you need also to install Rtools from the following link:

https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools.

* **MacOS**\
If you are on MacOs run the following codes in the console:

``` r
brew install imagemagick@6
brew install cairo
```

* **Ubuntu (tested on 18.04).**\

If you are on Ubuntu run the following codes in the console:
```
sudo apt install build-essential libcurl4-gnutls-dev libxml2-dev libssl-dev
sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev
sudo apt-get install libxt-dev
sudo apt install libmagick++-dev
sudo apt-get install libc6
sudo apt-get install libnlopt-dev

```

After that, open RStudio, check if you have already installed the ```{devtools}``` package and run the following code:

``` r
devtools::install_github("ShinyFabio/ADViSELipidomics")
```
We kindly suggest updating all the R packages requested during the installation process of ADViSELipidomics Shiny application. Be careful that if you need to install many packages and you decide to use compilation, the process could take a lot depending on your hardware and operating system.


## Usage
Once the installation is completed, run:

``` r
library("ADViSELipidomics")
run_ADViSELipidomics()
```

Depending on the screen size and especially the resolution of your monitor, ADViSELipidomics interface can be a bit different from how it was thought and built. Try to reduce or increment the zoom using **Ctrl** + **+** (plus) or **Ctrl** + **-** (minus) for Windows users or .... for Mac users.
